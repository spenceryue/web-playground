# Calendar Heat Map

A cool visualization idea from github, but could be applied to a number of different areas:

- DB transaction log
- Behavior Log
- Stock Price Movements
- Recurring Binary Events e.g. Earnings Releases, Weather, Sports Wins/Loss 

Version 0.01 - Goals
- Use D3 SVG
- Create a close to exact replica of the github visualization
