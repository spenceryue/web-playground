# Same as D3 project

create-react-app has some nice features namely:
 -error detection
 -no configure webserver
 -other stuff that i am unaware of

But this comes at the cost of the setup, it's a nuisance, I can't use my work computer because it's behind a proxy and it breaks the create-react-app process. When I use my personal computer, it just takes a long time to get it set up. There are a number of files/dependencies that take time to download, if I'm relying on a CSN, this code will never be production ready. This is a playground though.

F12 error detection is fine anyways

python -m SimpleHTTPServer is a good enough http server.
